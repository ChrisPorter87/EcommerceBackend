## Description
In this assignment I have established the database and the routes to access different information which exists there.  The options have been created to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE information from tables created that are seeded by tags, products, and category seed files..

## Usage
It will be used by a company to monitor their inventory and view different items based on different search criteria..

## Installation
You will need to install sequelize, express, and mysql for this program.

## Tests
This file doesn't have Jest installed so you will need to install that yourself and create the test folder, as well as the files.
